description: "A Shiny app to explore the music and history of the band Phish."

<p>Last year, I combined two of my nerdiest passions to write <a href="https://www.tylerclavelle.com/blog/2017/phish/">a data-driven exploration of the band Phish</a>. I spent an embarrassing amount of time working on it, due in large part to the fact that there’s just so much music to explore. Rather than repeating the same process a second time, I decided to leverage the work I’d already done to make something interactive for other phans to enjoy. Turns out I spent an embarrassing amount of time on this as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://tylerclavelle.shinyapps.io/thePhactory/">The Phactory</a> is a free Shiny app for exploring the music and history of the band Phish. The app combines data from <a href="http://www.phish.net">phish.net</a> and <a href="https://phish.in">phish.in</a> to produce interactive graphs and maps. The goal was to create new data visualizations and I’m incredibly grateful to the phans who created and maintain these amazing resources.</p>
<p>There are three main sections:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Jamcharts:</strong> Interactive charts showing a song’s performance history, recommended jams, and average length. There’s also a table of every recording available on Phish.in with links to each track</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/phactory_jams.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Setlists</strong> - Setlists from phish.net, including a map of the venue location, show rating, and track links</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/phactory_setlists.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Tour map</strong> - Explore a map of the venues Phish has played throughout their career, including Europe and Japan. Filter venues by era, tour, year, or total shows.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/phactory_map.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There’s also a bookmark button that will generate a shareable link to the app in its current state - if you think a certain jamchart/setlist/map is really cool, bookmark it and send it to a friend!</p>
<p>Lastly, this is a constantly evolving project so please share any suggestions, bugs, or favorite parts!</p>
