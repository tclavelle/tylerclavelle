![This is me][1]

My name's Tyler Clavelle and I'm a Project Researcher for University of California, Santa Barbara's (UCSB)
[Sustainable Fisheries Group (SFG)](http://sfg.msi.ucsb.edu). I was born and raised in Shelburne, VT and graduated from Bucknell University in 2009 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology and Economics. Following college, I spent two years working as Assistant Manager of the [Bimini Biological Field Station (BBFS)](http://biminisharklab.com), a research lab in Bimini, Bahamas focused on studying the physiology and life history of the Lemon shark (*Negaprion brevirostris*). I left Bimini at the end of 2011 to return to graduate school where I earned my Master in Environmental Science and Management (MESM) degree from UCSB's [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](http://bren.ucsb.edu).
