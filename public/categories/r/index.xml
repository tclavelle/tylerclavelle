      <title>Structured literature reviews using R and Web of Science</title>

      <description>For those of us in academia, a lot of time is spent staying up-to-date on the latest scientific literature. Usually this entails sporadic searches on Google Scholar. Sometimes, however, a more thorough and systematic review of the literature is desired.
This code post will walk through how to conduct structured literature searches using the Web of Science API and the glue R package.
### Packages library(tidyverse) library(stringr) library(forcats) library(RColorBrewer) # devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;juba/rwos&amp;quot;) # run if rwos not already installed library(rwos) # Primary Keywords aqua &amp;lt;- c(&amp;#39;aquaculture&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;mariculture&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;fish farm&amp;#39;) fish &amp;lt;- c(&amp;#39;fishery&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;fisheries&amp;#39;) We’ll also look for studies that focus on several topics related to aquaculture and capture fisheries, including disease, genetics, and invasive species.</description>

      <description>Overview We all know the feeling; You find the perfect data set only to discover it’s held hostage in 30 pages of a PDF formatted by a drunk toddler or in 467.5 Excel worksheets spread across 19 workbooks emailed to you by a guy named Melvin. If you’re lucky, maybe there’s an online data platform where you can query some mythical database and download individual data files…One. At. A. Time. In a perfect world, however, all the data you’re nerdy heart could desire is freely accessible via an Application Programming Interface (API).</description>

      <description>“My geekiness is getting in the way of my nerdiness” - Patton Oswalt
 Phish is a quartet and stalwarts of the modern jam band scene they helped create in the late 80’s. Like their Deadhead contemporaries, Phish fans (phans) have an almost unhealthy obsession with the music, speaking in reverential tones of near mythical versions of songs, like 2015’s Tweezer -&amp;gt; Prince Caspian, while endlessly debating the details (for the record, no, I do not think they went back into Tweezer).</description>

      <title>Easy citations in RMarkdown with RefManageR</title>

      <description>It’s Monday (or at least it was when I started writing this), so what better way to make the week’s most boring day even more boring than to write about citations? Managing and formatting references for your research is, well, about as fun as it sounds. Fortunately, gone are the days of manually curating these lists and cut/pasting your way to an alphabetical bibliography. In this post, I’ll demonstrate how to use the RefManageR package to manage your references and easily automate citations and bibliographies in RMarkdown documents.</description>

      <title>Building a Blog with Blogdown and GitHub</title>

      <description>Why Blog? When I first started learning to code in R, Google was (and still is) my go-to when I had a question. It didn’t take long to realize that this generally brought me to one of two destinations - StackOverflow or [Insert Name]’s blog. So, I created a StackOverflow account and decided to start my own data science blog. However, I didn’t quite know where to start and spent most of 2016 scoping different platforms.</description>
